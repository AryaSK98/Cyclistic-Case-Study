## Cyclistic Case Study
This case study is done as a part of Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. Given the role of a junior data analyst in the marketing analyst team of a (fictional) bike-share company, Cyclistic, located in Chicago, our objective is to find how the two types of riders - annual members and casual riders, use cyclistic bikes differently in order to design marketing strategies to convert casual riders into annual members.


The data required for the case study is directly downloaded from the website of Divvy Bikes, a bike-share system in Chicago, which is made available for public use.

Visualization was done using Tableau.
